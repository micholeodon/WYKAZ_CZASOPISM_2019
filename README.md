# WYKAZ_CZASOPISM_2019

## Bit of history ...
In 2019 [Ministry of Science and Higher Education in Poland](https://www.gov.pl/web/science) announced updated list of journals and conferences (available [here](https://www.bip.nauka.gov.pl/akty-prawne-mnisw/komunikat-ministra-nauki-i-szkolnictwa-wyzszego-z-dnia-31-lipca-2019-r-w-sprawie-wykazu-czasopism-naukowych-i-recenzowanych-materialow-z-konferencji-miedzynarodowych-wraz-z-przypisana-liczba-punktow.html) in Polish). Every scientist that would publish in any of selected journals or would attend to any of selected conferences will gain special points. These points are important during grant or scholarship application and provide some measure of scientist's excellence. We, scientists are not necessarily satisfied with that solution, thus we locally call this phenomenon the "punktoza". 

## Usage

Go to the project folder and run following command in your terminal:

```
$ python WYKAZ.py
```

After loading you will see:

Choose `1` to search the list of journals or `2` to search the list of conferences.
After selection you will be asked to provide range of points of your scope (integer numbers).
Enter positive integer number (range 0 to 200) and hit ENTER to provide a limit on minimum number of points.
Do it again for maximum number of points.

For example:

```
